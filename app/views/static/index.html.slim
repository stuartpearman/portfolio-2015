          h2 Hi, I'm Stuart.
          p Ever since I was a kid I've always loved building things. My craft has matured since then, but I still haven't lost the joy I get from thinking up new creations. I specialize in front-end web development, but I am always trying to expand my skillset with fresh projects in all imagineable categories.
